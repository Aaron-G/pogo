* add tls sockets and cert checks to WorkerConnection.pm
* Pogo::Object::Event extends Object::Event and adds

      $self->event_relay( "name" )

  which simply calls

      $w->reg_cb( "name" => sub {
          my( $self, @args ) = @_;
          $self->event( "name", @args );
      });

  (but watch for the '$self' closure)

* AnyEvent server vs. mod_perl

* rename worker_connect(ed)

* resilient to JSON errors (eval)

* $self->{ worker_handle } = AnyEvent::Handle->new(
  needs to handle a list of workers
