NAME
    Pogo - Run commands on many hosts in a controlled manner

DESCRIPTION
    Pogo is a highly scalable system for running arbitrary commands on many
    hosts in a controlled manner.

    It is mostly used for quick mass software deployments on server farms
    while making sure only an allowed number of nodes are upgraded in
    parallel to ensure business continuity.
